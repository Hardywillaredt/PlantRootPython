Switching listS to vecS for the last property both on bMetaGraphand bSkeleton
- this may end up correlating to increased efficiency in the mapping python iterator

for edges we want to be able to do coloration by....
thickness
width
ratio
component (less care)

we also want to keep track of edges which are still 'present' - eg mapped to a metaedge



for nodes we want to be able to do coloration by...
thickness
width
degree
component

we also want to be able to add nodes?




we dont want to copy shit every time


we need to be able to iterate over something and apply those colorations


NO MAS OF THE LINEGL and NODEGL bull

everything in c++???????

pretend python doesn't exist
